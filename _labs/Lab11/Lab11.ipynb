However, for our purposes we just need to understand a few basics:\n",

The server then sends back either the contents of that page with a HTTP code `200`, meaning everything worked, or it sends back an error like `404`, meaning that you asked for a page it doesn't know how to find. You can read more about [HTTP Error codes here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).\n",
        "3. Your browser then takes that page, perhaps issuing even more requests to other pages to grab content like rich media, and then puts all this together into an interactive display that you can use on your desktop.\n",

        "Luckily there is a great library called [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) which can handle many of these things for us. Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.\n",

The first thing we do is get the contents of the webpage and then load it into a Beautiful Soup object, which gives us an easy way to navigate bits of the page. We can use the `prettify` specifier to parse John's webpage from above into the various tags of an HTML page."
